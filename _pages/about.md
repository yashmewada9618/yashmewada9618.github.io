*Welcome to my robot realm, where wires get tangled, circuits dance, and robots ponder the meaning of life, one glitch at a time!*

Hi! I am Yash Mewada, a **Masters in Robotics** student with a concentration in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **[Northeastern University](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-robotics-17772/){:target="\_blank"}**. I did my Bachelors. in **Instrumentation and Control Engineering** from **[Vishwakarma Government Engineering College](https://vgecg.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}**, India in 2022. I became inclined toward Robotics and Automation during my undergrad where I was a part of my university’s **[robotics club](https://www.gturoboticsclub.in/){:target="\_blank"}** for over 3 years and there I served as both a Technical Core Electronics member and a Management member.


During the tenure of 3 years, I learned and implemented control systems and autonomous and semi-autonomous robots. My goal is to continue learning and growing throughout my career which is why I came to Boston to pursue my Master’s.


My research is in Probabilistic Robotics i.e **SLAM, Perception, Motion Planners, and Autonomous Navigation** i.e the technologies and methodologies that make Autonomous Mobile Robots AUTONOMOUS.
I have a deep passion for such technologies and which is why I am constantly learning and exploring these areas.
