        - Here we are working on High vehicle speed and off-road environments each presenting exciting challenges for modern autonomy pipelines. 
          To achieve high speed, the algorithms must quickly reason about the massive amount of data coming from various sensor streams. To navigate off-road, it is critical to understand both the geometry and semantics of the scene (e.g., a robot may be able to drive through soft bushes but not a fallen log). Our work is focused on learning a cost-to-go estimator to enable aggressively, online model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planning.
        - We aimed to develope a 3D semantic map of the environment by fusing the RGB frame of the camera with a 3D lidar. This fused data was capable of segmenting the point cloud of object classes.
        - Research work on High-Speed, off-road Autonomy in robots using online MPC (Model Predictive Control) based motion planning.

    - title: Embedded Software Intern
      institution: Studio Carbon, Gandhinagar, India
      year: March 2022 - Sept 2022
      description:
        - As an Embedded software intern I was reponsible for programming and developing the mathematics of a smart fitness device. This device utilised a small laser pointer on top of a small laser based distance sensor. This whole assembly rotated on top of a 3d printed cylinder with the help of a DC encoded motor that gave the Yaw motion to the device. 
        - The pitch motion was acheived with the help of a small stepper motor. Here I designed a feed-forward and PID control system, reducing motor positioning error from 20° to 5° increasing the accuracy of the motor positioning, and programmed the firmware for a smart stepper motor. 
        - Apart from this I was also reponsible for programming a BLE stack for a smart fitness device, enabling seamless communication with a mobile app. I also developed a closed-loop control system for a laser-based distance sensor, capable of accurately counting the number of taps.

      institution: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTUROBOTICSCLUB" target="_blank">GTU Robotics Club</a>, Gandhinagar, India
      year: 2019 - 2022
      description:
      - This is the place where it all started. For a tenure of 1 year (2019 - 2020) I was a part of a small software group with a team of 45 members. I was responsible for programming the robot, actuating its actuators on time, making the robot perform the tasks as per the theme given by the host country, and completing the task within the time frame of 3 mins. Here we implemented and also made use of smart closed-loop motor drivers. 
      - For the second year, we mentored a team of 45 members by providing them with training in basic robotics (electronics and mechanical). This year we implemented PID control on IMU and wheel odometry for robot motion and used Free-RTOS to control various actuators of the robot. Programmed a Swerve Drive robot and designed an in-house VNH-5019-based motor driver. Also, statistical learning was implemented in arrow throwing as per the theme.
      - Over the time period of 3 years in this club we developed and designed two semi-autonomous and manual robots as per the theme given by the host country.
      - Secured 3rd rank out of 32 domestic teams and was awarded the best design award by Toyota Motors (2020).
      - Acquired 10th rank at the National Level ABU-Robocon 2022.
      - Secured 2nd rank out of 28 teams in domestic and 7th out of 21 teams in ABU Robocon 2021, China.
